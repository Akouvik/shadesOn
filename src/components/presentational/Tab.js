          <h1>Hello World!</h1>
          <p>
            On my never ending journey to find a suitable 9 to 5 that wonâ€™t make
            me feel dead on the inside and excited for the future i have landed
            on programming. Programming is the new American dream in that you
            can make it in this industry so long as you work hard enough and are
            willing to put in the time and dedication.

            My name is Akouvi and I am a web Developer, amateur photography and
            I sometimes have unorganized thoughts that flow out of me and I post
            them on /blog. Feel free to connect with me
